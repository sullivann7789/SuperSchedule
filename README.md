# SuperSchedule
SuperSchedule by Noah Sullivan

### What is it?
This is a daily 24-hour planner which updates based on the time, and events that the user lists and saves on it. It can be closed, and then opened later, and still have the data you saved earlier in the day. 

The time slots also change color based on the hour. As seen below, past-time slots are grey, future-time slots are green, and present time-slots are red.
